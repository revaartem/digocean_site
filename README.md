## Introduction
Delicious Cafe is a web application built using the Python Django framework and utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project was developed as part of our curriculum at Prog Academy and aimed to teach us the fundamentals of building web applications using Django.

## Sections
The web app consists of two main sections - the Home page and Log In page. In addition, there is a hidden Manager section that can only be accessed by users who belong to the 'manager' group. In the Manager section, the manager can process client applications and table reservations.

## Home
The Home section contains the following sub-sections:

> [About](https://delicious-site-reva-scpli.ondigitalocean.app/#about) - providing information about the restaurant <br>
> [Menu](https://delicious-site-reva-scpli.ondigitalocean.app/#menu) - showcasing the restaurant's menu with categories and dishes, including name, price, and ingredients <br>

> [Book a Table](https://delicious-site-reva-scpli.ondigitalocean.app/#book-a-table) - a table reservation form <br>

## Styling
The app's front-end is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We have used a simple yet elegant template, which has been customized to match the branding of the restaurant.

## Manager Section
The Manager section is a hidden section only accessible to users belonging to the 'manager' group. In this section, the manager can process client applications and table reservations. Additionally, processed applications are archived and can be deleted if required.

## Conclusion
Delicious Cafe is a simple and elegant web application built using Django. It allows customers to view the restaurant's menu, make table reservations, and contact the restaurant. Meanwhile, the Manager section provides a streamlined way to process client applications and table reservations.
